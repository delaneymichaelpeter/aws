# Items To do

# AutoScaling Tasks
-) Duplicate script into a CloudFormation
-) Duplicate script into a Python or Go Script


# CloudWatch Task
-) CloudWatch monitoring can be initiated across your AutoScaling Group, so if you have a group of ec2
   instances in an autoscaling group you can aggregate the metrics across  the grou. 
   Need to set this up after understanding CloudMetrics better for better understanding.

 -) Create a CloudWatch Alarm that tells AutoScaling to terminate an EC2 instance and start another one.
    This would be a good exercise.
